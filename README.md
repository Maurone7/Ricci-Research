# Ricci-Research
Research Code created for Dr. Ricci

All the files in this repository were created by me and used for research purposes with Dr. Ricci, Luca.
Since these will be used for personal research, and for papers under my name, email me at mauro.patimo@gmail.com before using them.

Most of these codes, if not all, are meant to be used for research on plotoplanetary disks. 

Pay attention that all of these files have been used for different purposes, and to read the comments at the beginning of each to find out the purpose of them.
